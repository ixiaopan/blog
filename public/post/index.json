                "body": "In this series , I'm going to go through some basic concepts of statistics required in Data Science.\nThere are two main branches of statistics :\n descriptive statistics tells us the statistics about data like mean, mode and standard deviation, which you've learned in high school.\n inferential statistics, on the other hand, uses a random dataset sampled from population to make inferences about population. They are totally two different things. Now let's start from descriptive statistics.\n  But now we will focus on descriptive statistics, specifically, the central tendency and dispersion. Central tendency measures the center of the data while dispersion measures how spread out a given data is.\nCentral tendency Mean, mode and median are three mainly used measures of central tendency.\nMean Mean is the average of data and calculated by summing up all data values and then dividing them by the number of data.\n\\[ \\overline x = \\frac{\\sum_i^nx_i}{n} \\]\nFor instance, say we have a group of data 1,2,3,4,5,6, the mean is 3.5.\nMedian Though mean is widely used, it's sensitive to outliers. Suppose you have a set of data 1,2,3,4,5,6,100, after some calculations, you find that the mean is 17.28. However, it seems a bit strange since most of the data values is less than 10 except one extreme value 100, which strech the distribution of the whole data to the right. This is why median comes.\nTo get the median, firstly we need to sort the data in ascending order and then find the middle number that separate the data into two groups with the same size. In this example, the median is 4.\nMode Mode is the most frequent value. There could be one, two or more data values that have the same frequency and that freqency is the highest.\nDispersion Range Range is the distance between the maximum value and the minimum value. So range can tell us where the minimum and maximum value is. Again, range is sensitive to outliers.\n\\[ r=max - min \\]\nQuantile Quantiles are used to divide data into several equal-sized groups. The most widely used cut points are 0, 25, 50, 75, 100, denoted by min, Q1, Q2, Q3, max respectively.\nIQR or interquartile range measures where the central 50% of the data is.\n\\[ IQR = Q3 - Q1 \\]\nIQR can be used to detect outliers. Data that is greater than upper boundary or less than lower boundary is considered as an outlier.\n\\[ upper \\ boundary = Q3 + 1.5*IQR \\\\ \\]\n\\[ lower \\ boundary = Q1 - 1.5*IQR \\]\nVariance Deviation is the distance between a given data point and the mean. Since there are many data points, the variance calculates the average deviation from the mean.\nBut when you do this, you will always get a zero due to the definition of the mean.\n\\[ \\sum_i^n d_i = \\sum_i^n (x_i - \\overline x) = \\sum_i^nx_i - n\\overline x = n\\overline x - n\\overline x = 0 \\]\nFor simplicity, I omit the denominator n.\nOkay, let's ignore the sign and use the absolute value of the deviation.\n\\[ d_i = |x - \\overline x| \\]\nThough it works, the most popularly used method is calculate the square of the deviation.\n\\[ s^2 = \\frac{\\sum_i^n (x_i - \\overline x)^2}{n-1} \\]\nThough variance works fine, the value is a bit hard to interpret. For instance, we have 15 records of fish size measured in kilogram:\n[ 2.1, 2.4, 2.4, 2.4, 2.4, 2.6, 2.9, 3.2, 3.2, 3.9, 4.5, 6.3, 8.2, 12.8, 23.5 ].\nThe variance is 30.97. It means that if we randomly catch a fish, its weight would be 30.97 squared kilogram far away from the average weight. Emm...squared kilogram is an odd unit.\nStandard Deviation It's simple to solve this problem by taking the square root of the variance, which is standard deviation.\n\\[ s = \\sqrt{\\frac{\\sum (x - \\overline x)^2}{n-1}} \\]\nSo the standard deviation in the previous example is 5.56kg, which makes much sense.\nDistribution Skewness Skewness measures the symmetry of a distribution. It's quite common to have non-symmetric distributions.\n\nA left-/negative-skewed distribution\n it has a long left tail the mean is on the left of the median  A right-/positive-skewed distribution\n it has a long right tail the mean is on the right of the median  A skewed distribution implies that there are some special values that are larger/smaller than the common values. Let's see an example.\n\nFigure 3.2 shows the histogram of the fish sizes gathered from a fisherman. We can see that this distribution is right-skewed. The majority of fish size is between 0 and 3kg and there are a few special fishes that weigh over 3.5kg. It also can be seen that the average weight(1.67kg) is a bit higher than the median(1.62kg) shown in Table 3.2.\nReferences  Introduction to Statistics  "
