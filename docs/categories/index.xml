			<description>There are two main tasks in machine learning: regression and classfication. Today we will talk about regression, more specifically, linear regression. Linear regression is simple and easy to understand and maybe it&#39;s the first algorithm that most of people learn in the world of machine learning. So let&#39;s go!

			<description>In this post , I&#39;m going to go through some basic concepts of statistics required in Data Science.
There are two main branches of statistics :
 descriptive statistics tells us the statistics about data like mean, mode and standard deviation, which you&#39;ve learned in high school.
 inferential statistics, on the other hand, uses a random dataset sampled from population to make inferences about population.
  We will firstly focus on descriptive statistics, specifically, the central tendency and dispersion.</description>
