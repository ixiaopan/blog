			<description>&lt;p&gt;Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) are widely used for image classification, object detection and other tasks related to images or videos in the field of computer vision. Plenty of architectures based on convolution operation have been proposed in recent years, such as AlexNet and ResNet. So, how do CNNs work?  Why not use MLP? In this post, we will go through the fundamentals of CNN and several ConvNets to develop a big picture of CNN.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

			<title>Model Selection</title>

			<description>Model Complexity What is model complexity? Perhaps it mainly refers to the number of parameters that the model has. However, it does not mean that a model is complex if it has more parameters, although it is often the case. Generally, a simple model could result in underfitting, while a complex model could lead to overfitting. So, what factors affect the complexity of a model? Well, it is hard to say.</description>

			<title>Deep Learning - Neural Networks</title>

			<description>Neural Networks Neural networks are simply function compositions.
 Feedforward networks  $$ y = f(g(x, \theta_g), \theta_f) $$
 Recurrent networks  $$ y_t = f(y_{t-1}, x_t, \theta) $$
Generally, you can think of neural networks as function approximation machines, where we want to find appropriate $\theta$ to make $f^{*}$ as similar as possible to the true function $f$.
In practice, there are lots of things to consider when designing a neural network.</description>

			<title>Data Visualisation</title>

			<description>&lt;p&gt;Data visualisation is one of the modules in the first semester. Though I worked with web design and UI for several years, I&amp;rsquo;d never think about them deeply. As I learned more about design principles and the use of different charts, my aesthetic sense improved greatly. Here I listed some useful resources just for future reference.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

			<title>Deep Learning - Preliminary</title>

			<description>&lt;p&gt;So far, we&amp;rsquo;ve covered most of the things that we should know about machine learning, including concepts, optimization, and popular models under the hood. Yet, some advanced techniques, such as the Gaussian Process and MCMC, are not mentioned. We will talk about them later. From now on, we will move to Deep Learning. But before that, we are going to revisit some math knowledge.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

			<description>&lt;p&gt;From the beginning of July, I started to look for job opportunities in Data Science, Front-End, or both. The whole process is time-consuming and tedious. Now I have achieved my goal ( I mean the experience in seeking a job, I still have no offer for now ), so I am going to share my idea and recent thoughts about job seeking.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
