  <p>From the beginning of July, I started to look for job opportunities in Data Science, Front-End, or both. The whole process is time-consuming and tedious. Now I have achieved my goal ( I mean the experience in seeking a job, I still have no offer for now ), so I am going to share my idea and recent thoughts about job seeking.</p>
<h2 id="what-i-learned">What I learned</h2>
<p>Just a moment ago, I finished my final technical interview, which should have gone well, but it didn’t. I failed at the code part. The reason is that I was too confident in my coding skills, but the fact is that my mind was blank when I wrote code. So what happened? There are several reasons leading to this.</p>
<h3 id="overconfident">Overconfident</h3>
<p>I have to admit that my programming skills have indeed become poorer.</p>
<p>The prime reason is that I was overconfident in my programming skills. In fact, I have not written codes for almost one year. ( I mean writing code every day ) I have been accustomed to googling and looking up official docs so that I cannot remember some common APIs. In short, I focus more on utilising previous work experience to solve problems, instead of paying too much attention to specific functions. Anyway, anyone can write these functions from scratch.</p>
<p>Another reason is that I’m a bit evasive in programming. Why? Because of the heavy workload. So I somewhat avoid programming subconsciously. I hope I could have a life without work-related things during my study, totally relaxing myself.</p>
<h3 id="lack-of-preparation">Lack of preparation</h3>
<p>The second reason is that I was not fully prepared. In part because I was not familiar with the interview pattern/process. Well, I had never attended a video interview before. I didn&rsquo;t know how it runs. But basically, I was blindly confident in myself.</p>
<p>On the other hand, I applied for a new position (software engineer), which is a mix of frontend, machine learning and database. To be honest, SQL is not my cup of tea. I rarely use it during my work. I am not sure what questions will be asked to me in the interview. I had no previous interview experience to learn from.</p>
<h3 id="english">English</h3>
<p>Poor English listening and communication skills. That&rsquo;s the hard part. On the one hand, I am not familiar with some technical terms in English (Machine Learning is okay, but some frontend terms are different from my understandings), though I am always reading technical documents in English. Well, that&rsquo;s another thing, you know. On the other hand, I am not able to express my thoughts completely and fluently due to poor vocabulary. Sounds very frustrating.</p>
<h2 id="what-to-do">What to do</h2>
<ul>
<li>Strengthen the understanding of basic machine learning concepts
<ul>
<li>Some concepts e.g. FP, FN are still not clear. I know the definition, but I am still confused when/how to use it and express it clearly. I need more hands-on experience.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Enhance programming skills
<ul>
<li>SQL</li>
<li>Python, NumPy and Pandas ( I often mixed the syntax of Python and JavaScript, oppps&hellip;)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>English??
<ul>
<li>no idea, since I am not sure whether I will stay abroad</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="why-data-science">Why Data Science</h2>
<p>At first, I was afraid to answer motivation questions since it was my first time to encounter such a question. Strictly speaking, this was my first time to think about this question seriously. I think the reason is that I had been working on frontend, consequently I take frontend for granted. But now I am switching to data science, I have to revisit it and find an answer for myself.</p>
<h3 id="short-answer">short answer</h3>
<p>So why data science? The short answer is.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Do what I want  to do - experience different jobs</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I am still interested in frontend, but I would like to try something new. Life has no boundaries. Just do what you want to do if you are able to.</p>
<h3 id="long-answer">long answer</h3>
<p>The long answer is</p>
<blockquote>
<p>First, I had a strong desire to study last year. Meanwhile, I became interested in data, so data science was on my shortlist for the future degree.</p>
<p>Second, I believe that machine learning and AI are the future trends of technology since many companies have realised the importance and value of data. Big data applications are everywhere. So I think it&rsquo;s an exciting job which could bring big changes to the world and has a bright career prospect.</p>
<p>Third, as a developer, I want to be a full-stack developer, not limited to frontend or backend. In other words, I desire to improve my competitiveness.</p>
<ul>
<li>Any product needs a UI interface, which requires the knowledge of frontend.</li>
<li>Any application creates data, which requires machine learning to inspire insights from data.</li>
</ul>
<p>Thus, as a compound developer with the knowledge of both machine learning and frontend, I believe I have more choices.</p>
</blockquote>
