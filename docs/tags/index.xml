			<title>Semantic Web</title>

			<description>&lt;p&gt;In semester 2, I took a module called &lt;strong&gt;Semantic Web Technologies&lt;/strong&gt;. There are some reasons why I choose this module. At first glance, the name itself sounds not appealing. Actually, it does. But it&amp;rsquo;s still on my shortlist because I&amp;rsquo;ve been working on the web for many years and I wondered what the semantic web is.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

			<title>Singular Value Decomposition</title>

			<description>Change of Basis Suppose there is a point in the 2D space, how do you describe it? One common way is to use Cartesian coordinate system to list a pair of numbers, such as (x, y). Perhaps there are some people who don&amp;rsquo;t know Cartesian coordinates, and they might randomly choose a set of vectors as their basis of the coordinate space. For example, the red point in Figure 1 is (-4, 1) from our standard view defined by the gray vectors while the coordinate is (-1, 2) if we look at the same point from another angle defined by the blue vectors.</description>

			<title>An E2E Project - EDA</title>

			<description>&lt;p&gt;So far, we have discussed many algorithms, such as linear regression and ensemble methods. It&amp;rsquo;s time to kick off a project from scratch to learn how a real machine learning project works.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

			<title>Ensemble Methods</title>
			<link>https://ixiaopan.github.io/blog/post/ensemble-methods/</link>

			<guid>https://ixiaopan.github.io/blog/post/ensemble-methods/</guid>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;Ensemble means a group of people or a collection of things.Thus, ensemble methods means rather than using a single model, we will use a group of different models to gain a better prediction. In fact, ensemble methods often outperform other models in Kaggle competitions. In this post, we will talk about the most popular ensemble methods , including voting, bagging, and boosting.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

			<title>Decision Tree</title>
			<link>https://ixiaopan.github.io/blog/post/decision-tree/</link>

			<description>&lt;p&gt;The way decision tree works is similar to the way we make decisions in real life. For example,when you are going to watch a movie, you might have some questions on your head, such as &amp;lsquo;Is it a fiction movie? Is it directed by David Fincher?&amp;rsquo;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

			<title>Linear Regression 02</title>
			<link>https://ixiaopan.github.io/blog/post/linear-regression-02/</link>

			<description>&lt;p&gt;In the last post, we talked about simple linear regression. However, we only considered one predictor. In fact, it&amp;rsquo;s quite common to have mulitple attributes in real-world problems. For example, if we want to predict the price of a car, we have to consider many factors like car size, manufacturer and fuel type. Clearly, the simple linear regression is not suitable for this case. Therefore, we need to extend it to accommodate multiple predictors.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

			<title>Bias-Variance dilemma</title>

			<guid>https://ixiaopan.github.io/blog/post/bias-variance-dilemma/</guid>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;When you learn more about machine learning, you must  hear people talking about high bias or high variance something like that. What does they mean by &amp;lsquo;high bias&amp;rsquo; or &amp;lsquo;high variance&amp;rsquo;?&lt;/p&gt;</description>

			<description>&lt;p&gt;There are two main tasks in machine learning: regression and classification. Today we will talk about regression, more specifically, linear regression. Linear regression is simple and easy to understand and possibly the first algorithm that most people learn in the world of machine learning. So let&amp;rsquo;s go!&lt;/p&gt;</description>
