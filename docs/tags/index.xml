			<title>Data Mining</title>

			<description>I am not sure what I learnt from this module is truly helpful for me because the content of this module is a hodgepodge of everything. The lecturers indeed taught some useful things, but the knowledge is more isolated, less integrate. It seems that they tried to cover everything, but it only scratched the surface due to time limits. Anyway, I gained some insights from this module, and I will talk about them in this post.</description>

			<title>Semantic Web</title>

			<description>&lt;p&gt;In semester 2, I took a module called &lt;strong&gt;Semantic Web Technologies&lt;/strong&gt;. There are some reasons why I choose this module. At first glance, the name itself sounds not appealing. Actually, it does. But it&amp;rsquo;s still on my shortlist because I&amp;rsquo;ve been working on the web for many years and I wondered what the semantic web is.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

			<title>Singular Value Decomposition</title>
			<link>https://ixiaopan.github.io/blog/post/svd/</link>

			<description>&lt;p&gt;Singular Value Decomposition(SVD) is an important concept in Linear Algebra. Any matrix can be decomposed into the multiplication of three matrices using SVD. In machine learning, SVD is typically used to reduce dimensionality. Another popular dimension reduction technique is PCA. We will cover both of them in this post.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

			<title>An E2E Project - EDA</title>

			<description>&lt;p&gt;So far, we have discussed many algorithms, such as linear regression and ensemble methods. It&amp;rsquo;s time to kick off a project from scratch to learn how a real machine learning project works.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

			<title>Ensemble Methods</title>
			<link>https://ixiaopan.github.io/blog/post/ensemble-methods/</link>

			<guid>https://ixiaopan.github.io/blog/post/ensemble-methods/</guid>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;Ensemble means a group of people or a collection of things.Thus, ensemble methods means rather than using a single model, we will use a group of different models to gain a better prediction. In fact, ensemble methods often outperform other models in Kaggle competitions. In this post, we will talk about the most popular ensemble methods , including voting, bagging, and boosting.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

			<title>Decision Tree</title>
			<link>https://ixiaopan.github.io/blog/post/decision-tree/</link>
			<pubDate>Mon, 19 Apr 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
			<guid>https://ixiaopan.github.io/blog/post/decision-tree/</guid>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;The way decision tree works is similar to the way we make decisions in real life. For example,when you are going to watch a movie, you might have some questions on your head, such as &amp;lsquo;Is it a fiction movie? Is it directed by David Fincher?&amp;rsquo;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

			<title>Linear Regression 02</title>
			<link>https://ixiaopan.github.io/blog/post/linear-regression-02/</link>
			<pubDate>Sat, 17 Apr 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
			<guid>https://ixiaopan.github.io/blog/post/linear-regression-02/</guid>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;In &lt;a href=&#34;https://ixiaopan.github.io/blog/post/linear-regression-01/&#34;&gt;the previous post&lt;/a&gt;, we talked about simple linear regression. However, we only considered one predictor. It&amp;rsquo;s quite common to have multiple predictors for real-world problems. For example, if we want to predict car prices, we should consider many factors like car sizes, manufacturers and fuel types. The simple linear regression is not suitable for this case. Therefore, we need to extend it to accommodate the multiple predictors.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

			<title>Bias-Variance dilemma</title>

			<guid>https://ixiaopan.github.io/blog/post/bias-variance-dilemma/</guid>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;When you learn more about machine learning, you must  hear people talking about high bias, high variance or something like that. What do they mean by &amp;lsquo;high bias&amp;rsquo; or &amp;lsquo;high variance&amp;rsquo;?&lt;/p&gt;</description>

			<description>&lt;p&gt;There are two main tasks in machine learning: regression and classification. Today we will talk about regression, more specifically, linear regression. Linear regression is simple and easy to understand. Perhaps it is the first algorithm that most people learn in the world of machine learning. So let&amp;rsquo;s go!&lt;/p&gt;</description>

			<description>&lt;p&gt;Statistics is one of the most important skills required to be a data scientist. There are two main branches of statistics:&lt;/p&gt;</description>
