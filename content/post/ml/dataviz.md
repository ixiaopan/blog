Data visualisation is one of the modules in the first semester. Though I worked with web design and UI for several years, I'd never think about them deeply. As I learned more about design principles and the use of different charts, my aesthetic sense improved greatly. Here I listed some useful resources just for future reference.

## Data story

Below are key points when you structure a data story

- Who is your audience?
- What do you want your audience to know?
- Pose a question to the audience
- Lead them through the data in a way they understand
- Give Context, and highlight key trends or events
- Conclude by answering the question



### Planning

Idea: the story you want to tell

Data: the evidence that support your idea

Hook: draw readers' attention

### Context & Detail

Why are you interested in this story?



### Question

What do you want your audience to know?

For example: House prices of London is higher than other areas in England.

- Claim: House prices of London is higher.
- Grounds: London is the capital of England.
- Warrant: Usually, capital of a country has better economy, since Lodon is the capital of England, the prices are higher.
- Backing: GDP, salary, history reason
- Rebuttal: Other areas out of London have lower prices
- Qualifiers: So, generally this is true in most time.
