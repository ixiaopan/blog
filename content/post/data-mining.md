I am not sure what I learnt from this module is truly helpful for me because the content of this module is a hodgepodge of everything. The lecturers indeed taught some useful things, but the knowledge is more isolated, less integrate. It seems that they tried to cover everything, but it only scratched the surface due to time limits. Anyway, I gained some insights from this module, and I will talk about them in this post.

## Market Basket Analysis





## Network
