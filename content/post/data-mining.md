I am not sure what I've learned from this module is truly helpful for me because the content of this module is a hodgepodge of many subjects. The lecturers indeed delivered something useful, but the knowledge is rather scattered and less integrated. It seems that they tried to cover everything, but in fact, they only scratched the surface due to time limits. Anyway, I gained some insights from this module, and I will talk about some topics I found interesting and useful in this post.



## Information Theory





## Market Basket Analysis





## Network





## Community Detection





## Link Prediction





## Pagerank
