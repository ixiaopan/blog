## Direced Graphical Model

In a direction graph, if there is a link starting from a to b, we say a is the parent of b and b is the child of a. The joint distribution over all variables $\bold x=\{x_1, x_2, ..., x_N\}$ in this graph is described as 
$$
p(\bold x) = \prod_i^N p(x_i|pa_i)
$$
where $N$ is the number of nodes, and $pa_i$ indicates the set of parents of $x_i$. For example, the joint distribution of the graph in Figure 1 is 
$$
p(a, b, c) = p(a)p(b|a)p(c|a,b)
$$
