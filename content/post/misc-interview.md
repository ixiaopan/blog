From the beginning of July, I started to look for job opportunities in Data Science, Front-End, or both. The whole process is time-consuming and tedious. Now I have achieved my goal ( I mean the experience in seeking a job, I still have no offer for now ), so I am going to share my idea and recent thoughts about job seeking.

## What I learned

Just a moment ago, I finished my final technical interview, which should have gone well, but it didn’t. I failed at the code part. The reason is that I was too confident in my coding skills, but the fact is that my mind was blank when I wrote code. So what happened? There are several reasons leading to this.



### Overconfident

I have to admit that my programming skills have indeed become poorer.

The prime reason is that I was overconfident in my programming skills. In fact, I have not written codes for almost one year. ( I mean writing code every day ) I have been accustomed to googling and looking up official docs so that I cannot remember some common APIs. In short, I focus more on utilising previous work experience to solve problems, instead of paying too much attention to specific functions. Anyway, anyone can write these functions from scratch.

Another reason is that I’m a bit evasive in programming. Why? Because of the heavy workload. So I somewhat avoid programming subconsciously. I hope I could have a life without work-related things during my study, totally relaxing myself.



### Lack of preparation

The second reason is that I was not fully prepared. In part because I was not familiar with the interview pattern/process. Well, I had never attended a video interview before. I didn't know how it runs. But basically, I was blindly confident in myself.

On the other hand, I applied for a new position (software engineer), which is a mix of frontend, machine learning and database. To be honest, SQL is not my cup of tea. I rarely use it during my work. I am not sure what questions will be asked to me in the interview. I had no previous interview experience to learn from.



### English

Poor English listening and communication skills. That's the hard part. On the one hand, I am not familiar with some technical terms in English (Machine Learning is okay, but some frontend terms are different from my understandings), though I am always reading technical documents in English. Well, that's another thing, you know. On the other hand, I am not able to express my thoughts completely and fluently due to poor vocabulary. Sounds very frustrating.



## What to do

- Strengthen the understanding of basic machine learning concepts
  - Some concepts e.g. FP, FN are still not clear. I know the definition, but I am still confused when/how to use it and express it clearly. I need more hands-on experience.
- Enhance programming skills
  - SQL
  - Python, NumPy and Pandas ( I often mixed the syntax of Python and JavaScript, oppps...)
- English?? 
  - no idea, since I am not sure whether I will stay abroad



## Why Data Science



Almost everyone will ask me this question — Why data science? I'm still asking myself, too.



### Short answer



> Do what I want - experience different jobs



I am still interested in frontend, but I would like to try something new. Life has no boundaries. Just do what you want if you are able to. Maybe the worst case is that I would go back to Frontend. Well, it's not too bad, after all, I don't hate frontend at all.



### Long answer



First, I had a strong desire to study last year. Meanwhile, I started to become interested in data, so after doing research, I chose data science as my master's degree.



Second, I believe that machine learning and AI are the future trends of technology since we are generating more and more data and companies have realised the importance and value of data. Big data applications are everywhere. So I think it's an exciting job which could bring big changes to the world and have a bright career prospect.



Third, as a developer, I dream to be a full-stack developer. At least I don't limit myself to frontend or backend only. As a compound developer with the knowledge of both machine learning and frontend, I believe I have more choices.



Besides, I like to try something new. I also expect how far I can go.
