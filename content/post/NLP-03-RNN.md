I am going to write several articles to go through my MSc project briefly (Hopefully I can do it). To be honest, it's a bit hard for me to complete this research. Perhaps I should choose another topic about NER, such as NER in fake news. Anyway, I have to complete it in the next month. Well, this post will cover the related work on NER including models, data and domain adaption, which is the initial work of my research.

## NER



Named entity recognition (NER) is a classic natural language processing (NLP) task that identifies important chunks such as name and organization in a given text. The output labels can be used for a wide range of downstream tasks. For instance, many headhunting companies embed NER models into their softwares to extract candidates' information such as name and email from their resumes.
