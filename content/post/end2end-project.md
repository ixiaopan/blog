We have discussed many algorithms, such as linear regression and ensemble methods. It's time to kick off a project from scratch to learn the pipeline of a machine learning project.

## Overview



There are 8 steps discussed in the book "Hands-on Machine Learning" to do a machine learning project,

- Frame the problem
- Get the data
- Explore the data
- Prepapre the data
- Explore many different models
- Fine-tune
- Deploy



In this post, we will cover the first 3 parts.



## Frame the problem



The first step is to define you problem. People are unlikely to do things without reasons, right?. So ask yourself, what problem do you want to solve? Why are they interested in you? What's your objective? Are there any solutions out there?

As an example, we are going to predict used car prices because accurate prices prediction can help both buyers and sellers. For buyers, it can ensure the money that customers invest on used cars to be worthy. For used car dealers, they might want to know which factors influence car prices most so as to adjust sales strategy and offer a better prediction to customers. Therefore, there is a necessity for building a used car price prediction system.



## Get the data

There are many ways to get the desired data. You can write a scaper to download the data from related websites or you can search related data from some public databases. And Kaggle is one of the most popular platforms that enables us to achieve our data science goals. The data we used in this project is [Used Cars Dataset - Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/austinreese/craigslist-carstrucks-data).



## EDA



EDA stands for Exploratory Data Analysis, which is an important part throughout the project. In this step, we are trying to get insights from the data. Specifically, we will study the characteristics of each feature, find the correlation between them, visualize the data, identify the quality of the data like outlier detection.
