So far, we've covered most of the things that we should know about machine learning, including concepts, optimization, and popular models under the hood. Yet, some advanced techniques, such as the Gaussian Process and MCMC, are not mentioned. I am afraid that I don't have time to do this because I have to do my summer project, which requires me to dive into deep learning.

To this end, I am going to write something about deep learning, which I hope could improve my understanding of it, particularly RNN. In the first article of this series, we will learn how a neural network works by implementing two machine learning models, linear regression and logistic regression, and revisit the loss function cross-entropy.
