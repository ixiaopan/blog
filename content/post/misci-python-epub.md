Note that this script can only convert html to epub. In other words, only books in HTML format can be downloaded. 

### Books with chapter list

Books may or may not have a chapter list. For books with a chapter list, just type the URL. For example, the below one.

```
https://booksvooks.com/selfish-shallow-and-self-absorbed-sixteen-writers-on-the-decision-not-to-have-kids-pdf.html
```

### Books without chapter list

For books without a chapter list, you need to add the total page number to the page URL. For example, the book `this is going to hurt`Â  does not have a chapter list, so the url is

```
https://booksvooks.com/fullbook/this-is-going-to-hurt-pdf-adam-kay.html?page=32
```


The book will be downloaded in the folder `booksVooks/` or `jinjiang` based on your source.

```
- booksVooks
  - thisisgoingtohurtpdfadamkaypage32.epub
```
